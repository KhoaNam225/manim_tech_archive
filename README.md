# The Manim Tech Archive

This archive contains Manim code to create videos that explain different technical concepts in the easy to understand way.

## Why Manim?

The reason why I chose to create tech explain videos using Manim is that I want to find a different way (not necessarily better) than using a traditional PowerPoint slides deck to explain the technical concepts which sometimes could be boring. Also, as I'm a developer, I always prefer to do code! That's what I always enjoy doing after all!
